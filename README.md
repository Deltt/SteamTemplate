# Quick-Start GodotSteam Template Project

This project contains a minimal setup of interchangable SteamMultiplayerPeer and ENetMultiplayerPeer to quickly get started with multiplayer development.

# Steam + LAN

The template allows to play scenes locally with multiple instances as well as playing with a friend (or co-developer) via Steam online, without any additional changes necessary to the netcode (IF Godots High-Level-Multiplayer-API is used).

The project uses the GDExtensions "GodotSteam" and "SteamMultiplayerPeer".
